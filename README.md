# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
A machine learning model trained to predict survival of passengers based on their details

OBJECTIVE

1.Predict Passenger Survival: Develop a Machine Learning model to predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on various features.

2.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values, convert categorical data into numerical form, and normalize the dataset for better model performance.

3.Feature Engineering: Select and transform the most relevant features to improve model accuracy.

4.Model Training & Evaluation: Train multiple Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.) and evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

FILES

tested.csv : The dataset used to create the machine learning model

titanicsurvivalpredict.ipynb : the training of machine learning model

titanic_survival_model.pkl : the machine learning model created

titanicpredictor.ipynb : the python code to deploy and use the ml model to predict the survival

STEPS TO DEPLOY THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL

1.Install necessary python libraries preferably in jupyter lab.

2.upload the  'titanic_survival_model.pkl' and 'titanicpredictor.ipynb' to jupyter lab.

3.run the 'titanicpredictor.ipynb'.

4.Enter the passenger details.
